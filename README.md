# CVE-2022-26138 POC

## Description
```
The Atlassian Questions For Confluence app for Confluence Server and Data Center 
creates a Confluence user account in the confluence-users group with 
the username disabledsystemuser and a hardcoded password. A remote, 
unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded password could
exploit this to log into Confluence and access all content accessible 
to users in the confluence-users group. 
This user account is created when installing versions 2.7.34, 2.7.35, and 3.0.2 of the app.
```
